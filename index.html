    <h1> Hi! I'm Elliott. </h1>
    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I'm a computer science major and CIS student advisor here at Towson University.
    I graduate in May 2025! :D </br>
    My hobbies include playing & listening to music, playing video games, and video editing.
    I'd like to go into software engineering/development and/or video game development as a career.
    Making music as a career could be fun too, though.
    </p>
